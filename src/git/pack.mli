        This is the main algorithm about the serialization of the git
        object in a PACK file. The purpose is to order and delta-ify
        entries.

        [getter] is a function to access to the real inflated raw of
        the git object requested by the hash. This function must
        allocate the raw. The algorithm takes the ownership anyway.

        [tagger] is a function to annotate an entry as preferred to
        serialize firstly.

        [window] corresponds to the number of how many object(s) we
        keep for the delta-ification or, if [memory] is [true], ho
        many byte(s) we keep for the delta-ification. The client can
        control the memory consumption of this algorithm precisely if
        he wants.

        [depth] is the maximum of the delta-ification allowed.

        If you want to understand the algorithm, look the source
        code. *)
