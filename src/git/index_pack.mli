    notified to the [make] function. This [Cstruct.t] should never
    change by the client. All processes available in this module read
    only the content.

    By {i lazy}, we mean that we don't try to make an OCaml value
    which contains all binded values available in the IDX file - and,
    by this way, we don't process entirely the file. We read values
    only when the client ask to get these values - {i call by need}.
    Use this decoder with the {i syscall} [mmap] to get the expected
    {!Cstruct.t} could be useful when [mmap] do a lazy read. *)

    implementation. We constraint the {!Hash.S} module to compute a
    {Cstruct.t} flow. This module is a {i non-blocking} decoder with a
    pure state of the IDX file. It's better to use this module instead
    {!Lazy} if the client wants an OCaml representation of the IDX
    file - he can construct this specific OCaml value step by step
    with this decoder like a Radix tree.

    In the result, if the client construct an efficient data-structure
    (like a Radix tree) when he decodes the IDX file, the [find]
    operation should be more fast than the {!Lazy.find}. However, the
    {!Lazy.make} operation could be more fast than to decode and to
    construct an OCaml value. *)
