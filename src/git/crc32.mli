(** Implementation of the CRC-32 checksum in OCaml. *)

type t = int32
(** The type of the CRC-32 checksum. *)

val digest: t -> ?off:int -> ?len:int -> Cstruct.t -> t
(** [digest crc cs] digests the buffer [cs] and produce a new CRC-32
    checksum (derived from [crc]). The default value of [off] is 0 and
    the default value of [len] is the length of [cs]
    ({!Cstruct.len}). *)

val digestv: t -> Cstruct.t list -> t
(** [digest crc css] applies {!digest} for each [Cstruct.t] elements
    of [css] with the default arguments and return the new CRC-32
    checksum.

    Is equivalent to: [(digest .. (digest crc cs1) csN)]. *)

val digestc: t -> int -> t
(** [digestc crc byte] derives the CRC-32 checksum [crc] with the byte
    [byte]. *)

val digests: t -> ?off:int -> ?len:int -> Bytes.t -> t
(** [digest crc by] digests the buffer [by] and produce a new CRC-32
    checksum (derived from [crc]). The default value of [off] is 0 and
    the default value of [len] is the length of [by]
    ({!Bytes.length}). *)

val of_int32: int32 -> t
(** [of_int32 v] casts an [int32] value to a CRC-32 checksum. *)

val to_int32: t -> int32
(** [to_int32 crc] casts the CRC-32 checksum to an [int32] value. *)

val pp: t Fmt.t
(** Pretty-printer for {!t}. *)

val default: t
(** A default and first value (without derivation) of the CRC-32
    checksum. *)

val eq: t -> t -> bool
(** [eq a b] returns [true] only when [a] equal [b]. Otherwise, it
    returns [false]. *)

val neq: t -> t -> bool
(** [neq a b] returns [true] only when [a] is different to [b].
    Otherwise, it returns [true]. Is equivalent to: [not (eq a b)]. *)
