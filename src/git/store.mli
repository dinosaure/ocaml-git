(** Implementation of a Git repository with a file-system back-end.

    This implementation is more complete than the memory back-end
    because firstly, Git was think to be use on a file-system. Then,
    because for each operations, we let the client to control the
    memory consumption.

    So we provide a more powerful API which let the user to notice
    aready allocated buffers outside this scope and process some I/O
    operations on pools. *)
